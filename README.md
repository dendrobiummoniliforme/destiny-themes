# Destiny Themes

This is a repository dedicated to transforming Destiny / Destiny 2 Shaders into VSCode Themes. 

This repository is not affiliated with Bungie, or Destiny. It is **unofficial**. The themes are just a fun way to celebrate my love of this game :)

## Status

There are a few open issues I could use help with, in the meantime I am thinking about how I can approach some automated enhancements for this repository, as well as how other's can contribute. Stay tuned for more progress.

## Contributing

I am working on a contributing file that will let others' design and merge new themes into the parent repository (Destiny Themes). In the meantime, until that structure is set, I will **not** be accepting new themes *at this point in time*. Only **open issues** will be considered, for now.

## Resources

These are some of the resources used to design each theme.
