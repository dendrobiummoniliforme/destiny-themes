# Change Log

All notable changes to the "Whisper of the Worm" extension will be documented in this file.

## [3.0.0]
* Major Changes:
    * Update CONTRIBUTING.md with Publishing information.
    * Refactor 1; split files into modules.
    * Refactor 2 image color extraction automation pipeline
    * Added Emerald Splash Theme.

## [2.0.0]
* Major Changes:
    * Refactored `src/*` to `src/GenerateTheme.js`.
        * This consolidates the files. Modules are the right approach, but I would like to take some time to think about that approach.
    * Added **Royal Dye** Theme.
        * Swatches `#DCA39C, #F1BCB4, #F1EAF3, #D0C7D1, #C5C0C1, #CE7366, #A4885F, #5A411E, #573B1D, #515457, #1B1A19, and #161415`.

## [1.0.0]
* Major Changes:
    * Changed the name from "Royal Treatment" to "Whisper of the Worm".
        * This is to make this repository a **general** store for all shaders that are transfered to VSCode themes.
        * I also love this Exotic.
    * Altered the repository structure.
    * Added a CONTRIBUTING.
    * Added a README.
    * Added a LICENSE.
    * Added an Icon.
    * Refactored theme generation tools.

* A Note on other pre-1.0.0 changes:
    * From 0.0.4 onward I decided that rapid change was more favourable than structure.
    * This resulted in quicker turn-around, and now, a stable project to contribute to.
    * From this point forward, the CHANGELOG MUST be updated per version of the project.
    * The CHANGELOG currently also does not match the tags on github. This will be in-sync from this point forward as well.

## [0.0.4]
Added:
* Re-added theme.

Note: This is my first VSCode Extension. There are bound to be some weird errors for a bit, bear with me :)

## [0.0.3]
Added:
* Icon, and image to display on the marketplace store.

## [0.0.2]
Added:
* Misc fixes; README changes.
